### Machine Learning based project repo
This repo contains Machine leanring assignments based on data analysis and prediciton.
Machine learning assignment 1.1 is related to Auto MPG with dataset obtained from UCI dataset
Machine learning assignment 1.2 is related to Car evalution with dataset obtained from UCI dataset


### CNN based model for Horse/Human Detection 
This CNN model was developed using Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras. This was done as a project by laurence from Coursera. 
The Dataset was used for training the model to be able to differentiate between Horse and Human!
